The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. They supply high quality PCBs at a very reasonable price. They also can provide SMT circuit assembly.

We thanks to our sponsor JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA for sponsoring us PCBs for this project circuit.

In this circuit, we are going to teach you making a simple electronics project. It is a LED flasher circuit, that you can make at home. To make this circuit, we are using NE-555 timer IC. To decorate your home or office you can use this circuit. This circuit also can be used for turning signal of all kind of autos and vehicle.

Using only a 9v battery, you can easily operate this circuit. You also can use 9v battery. You also can use a DC-9v SMPS power supply circuit.

NE555 Pin Out - 

NE555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation and oscillator applications. Derivatives provide two or four timing circuits in one package. There are totally 8 legs of a timer IC. 

As well as the 555 timer, there is also available the NE556 timer oscillator.

The internal block diagram and schematic of the 555 timer are highlighted with the same color across all three drawings to clarify, how the chip is implemented.

Its 8 legs Pin Out can be seen above.

1.	GND - The ground pin connects the 555 timer to the negative (0v) supply rail.


3.	TRIG - The negative input to comparator No 1. A negative pulse on this pin “sets” the internal Flip-flop when the voltage drops below 1/3Vcc causing the output to switch from a “LOW” to a “HIGH” state.


5.	OUT - The output pin can drive any TTL circuit and is capable of sourcing or sinking up to 200mA of current at an output voltage equal to approximately Vcc – 1.5V so small speakers, LEDs or motors can be connected directly to the output.


7.	RESET - This pin is used to “reset” the internal Flip-flop controlling the state of the output, pin 3. This is an active-low input and is generally connected to a logic “1” level when not used to prevent any unwanted resetting of the output.


9.	CONT - This pin controls the timing of the 555 by overriding the 2/3Vcc level of the voltage divider network. By applying a voltage to this pin the width of the output signal can be varied independently of the RC timing network. When not used it is connected to ground via a 10nF capacitor to eliminate any noise.


11.	THRES - The positive input to comparator No 2. This pin is used to reset the Flip-flop when the voltage applied to it exceeds 2/3Vcc causing the output to switch from “HIGH” to “LOW” state. This pin connects directly to the RC timing circuit.


13. DISCH - The discharge pin is connected directly to the Collector of an internal NPN transistor which is used to “discharge” the timing capacitor to ground when the output at pin 3 switches “LOW”.


8. VCC - This is the power supply pin and for general purpose TTL 555 
timers is between 4.5V and 15V.

 Circuit Connection – Step 1
  
  
To make this circuit, we need to follow a normal method of this time IC. 1st we need to connect 2 and 6 no leg of timer IC-NE555. Then we connect 4 and 8 no leg of NE-555 timer IC. It is a common connection for NE555 IC circuit. Specially,  if you want to make a LED light effect project. Remember, to make led light flasher circuit using NE-555 IC you might need this connection.


Now we connect 100µf/ 25v capacitor with the circuit. We connect capacitor negative leg with 1no leg of timer IC and connect capacitor positive leg with 2no leg of timer IC.


To make this circuit, we are using 68 KΩ resistor. We also can use 1KΩ and 68 KΩ resistor to make this circuit. To make this circuit, we need to make a parallel connection between one terminal of this two resistor. We connect parallel side with 7no led of timer IC and connect two different terminal with 6 and 8 no leg of timer IC.


  
Circuit Connection – Step 2

For better effect, we are using 12 piece led light circuit. We divide this led into 2 side. Then each side will contain 6 LEDS. Then we make a parallel connection in this 6 LEDS.


Now we make a series connection in this two side LEDS. Now we get 3 side . Connect this series side with 3no leg of timer IC. Connect negative side led with 4 no leg of timer IC and positive side led with 4no leg of timer IC.


For power supply, we are using DC 9v. You can use 9v battery or can use the power supply, that can provide DC 9v. Be careful about the power supply, because if you use more than 9v , then led light will blown away and the circuit may damage also.
